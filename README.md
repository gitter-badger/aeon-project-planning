AEON Project Planning 
======

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/aeon-project-planning/Lobby](https://badges.gitter.im/aeon-project-planning/Lobby.svg)](https://gitter.im/aeon-project-planning/Lobby?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

Nothing more than a Markdown README allowing for this repository and document to house a living preplanning document that is publicly available, accessible, and with all its revisions being equally so, as well as a space for raw, static documentation, as we'll be referring to, and for the most part adhering to, specific international standards, within reason (read: without being ridiculous and insane gits and sticklers for strict adherence to whatever rules just because)



Reconnaissance and Recognition
======



Team Members Thus Far
------
Two full stack developers confirmed. Third with expressed interest, but has not confirmed yet. I'm (drparadox) one of the two full stack developers here, and am not counting (reddit) /u/smooth_xmr as the other, to be clear. Two full stack developers will be sufficient, but a third would be welcome. Again, I'm still waiting on confirmation of their interest in involvement. 
	
Two Web developers, one specialized in UI and integration development, the other in systems development. In rebasing, we'll venture into web wallet territory, allowing each to reverberate and expound upon the other, as rebasing does not account for effort required to feasibly, realistically bring a web wallet into existence, even though rebasing with no mind being paid to the web wallet is a given. 

One QA/PM, willing to bring QA and code management to the table, and may be the most logical bridge connecting ongoing development to ongoing community discussion. Logic here being people want to be kept up to date, but no one should be solely responsible for managing Aeon PR, yet development also needs to hear the community as much as it needs to inform the community, so QA/PM involvement here may allow for more informative updates to occur more often. It is here, I believe, the gap between goings on, and people like (reddit) /u/katiecharm who try to themselves stay informed while keeping others informed in turn.

This work will technically be against two separate projects, the Aeon Web Wallet and Aeon Rebase, according to the declarations and descriptions of their respective bounty posts, and involves a level of effort and amount of work which can reasonably and realistically be approached and completed by two teams working partially in tandem. 



Bounty Hunting: Plan for the Worst, Hope for the Best
-----
In selecting a three man team for the Rebase work, in which I'm one of the members, and a three man team for the Web Wallet work, in which I'm one of the members, it also allows for each bounty, once divided, to be equivalent to that received by the other 4 members on the collective team. Specifically, 5 people, bounty of 50,000 AEON total once combined, team of 5 each receives equal amounts. In the event the bounties are actually awarded to these teams, I refuse to assume responsibility or demand the obligation be granted to myself over said monies and amounts, and whatever is awarded should be divided according to what I've defined just now. Please acknowledge this, bounty holders, as per your convenience and once after, as soon as possible. 

Team members, please voice your opinions and concerns now, as this is an attempt to address the positive outcome and awarded monies as its own problem, and we'd be foolish to ignore it, but silly to waste much time here arguing. 

In being a part of this work I'm about to lead a team into, I would like for you to either accept and move forward with us, or reject and back out of the team, now. Whatever it is that is done, whatever money that is awarded, whatever happens, no one will be receiving less or more than the other. If this isn't agreeable, then please and by all means, form another team, do it yourself, present a better idea, but on this particular point, I unfortunately cannot be persuaded otherwise 

I would also ask some level of confidence be provided by the bounty holders in being able to pay the bounty, and remaining willing to pay the bounty, once its requirements are satisfied and project work considered complete for any given bounty. 

Best not to wait for these types of conversations to occur after the fact, and while it may be a bit distracting now, now is the only time in which this conversation will reasonably be held, and yield an agreeable solution all may stick to and rely on after all is said and done. 



Primary Objectives for Work against Web Wallet and Rebase Bounties
------

First, the following will be drafted, then publicly released, vetted, and refined by the community:

1. Software Project Management Plan (IEEE Standard 1058) relative to known requirements for work contributing towards rebasing AEON
   1. Allows for some quality control of a rough SPMP up front, where community reviews and discusses first pass to solidify collective 30,000ft view of the AEON rebase and a workable project
   2. Allows for the bare minimum authority and process models to be established, where space is created that allows for people to assume responsibility as opposed to it being delegated, be accountable only to themselves, be aware of who to consult based on who has made themselves available and who among them is likely to provide that which is needed, inform only a system of one's efforts and completions (think RACI, except with deadlines, managers, punishable offenses removed entirely)

2. Software Requirements Specification (IEEE Standard 830) based on exhaustively defined requirements for work contributing towards rebasing AEON
   1. Allows for functionality not previously, explicitly defined, to be identified, discussed, and included in requirements specification or triaged as future work for a later version
   2. Allows for functionality assumed to exist to be isolated, discussed, and triaged as future work for a later version or excluded outright

3. Part out requirements as units of work, to form arcs, to form milestones, to then form functional roadmap where identified dependencies on any given unit of work, arc, milestone dictates precedence, priority  
   1. Allows for logical collapse of work into more rigid structures that can be worked in and against
   2. Ensures capacity and time do not influence work, by any given person, for any given task, where tasks themselves are constrained only by its known dependencies, if and when they exists

4. Integrate vetted requirements, arc, milestones, as per their evolution in previous point, into primary Github repo for each project respectively, so that, at the very least, work is compartmentalized into milestones and further separated by project space itself
	1. Allows for existing and future issues, requests, revisions, wiki content, and so on, to be contained in a single space
	2. Provides the community with reliability in endpoint, transparency in its movements, access and ability for involvement
	
5. In having planned the work, and without the need for oversight or management, those involved work the plan, police themselves, and may be expected to do the work in which they agreed to do and felt comfortable being assigned, will have the work revoked and managed by someone else in the event they simply disappear. 
	1. Allows for us to continue moving forward
	2. Does not imply the team member is then removed from the team, which is another reason why I should have no control or say of who gets what passed my initial request of fair and equal division of combined bounty for all team members involved




Additional Projects for Bounty Consideration
------

Presenting this to /u/smooth_xmr and /u/katiecharm for consideration, is all.

1. Desktop Wallet
   * While an argument has been made and approach loosely defined that encompasses both the Web Wallet and Rebase related work, I believe a separate bounty should be considered and discussed for the Desktop Wallet related work, as such work, based on current understanding, is outside of Web Wallet and Rebase work scope.
